			<h2>What is Craniosynostosis&#63;</h2>
				<div class="description">
					<p>At birth, a child’s skull is made of separate bones with growth plates called ‘sutures’ between them. These joints allow the skull to grow. Over time, the sutures close and the bones fuse. Craniosynostosis occurs when bones in a child’s skull fuse prematurely.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="single" id="firstsection">
					<h3>Common types of craniosynostosis</h3>
						<h4>Sagittal Craniosynostosis</h4>
							<p>Sagittal craniosynostosis refers to the premature closing
								of the suture that runs at the top of the head, from front
								to back. Babies are usually identified with abnormal head
								shapes soon after birth. When this happens, the bones
								put pressure on the brain and may keep it from growing
								normally. We recommend parents treat their children early
								– preferably before six months of age.</p>


						<h4>Metopic Craniosynostosis</h4>
							<p>Metopic craniosynostosis refers to the premature closing
								of the suture that runs down the middle of the forehead
								and toward the nose. The metopic suture is the first
								suture in an infant’s head to close (fuse) as it grows. When
								this suture fuses prematurely, it can impact the baby’s
								appearance and brain development. Babies with metopic
								synostosis have a noticeable ridge running down their
								forehead, causing the forehead to form a triangle shape.</p>


						<h4>Unicoronal Craniosynostosis</h4>
							<p>Unicoronal craniosynostosis refers to the premature
								closing of the suture that runs at the top of the head, from
								ear to top of the forehead. Unicoronal synostosis causes
								forehead and brow flattening on the affected side. On
								the opposite side, the forehead tends to be excessively
								prominent. The eye on the affected side may also have a
								different shape.</p>



					<h3 class="second">How is craniosynostosis treated?</h3>
					<p>Craniosynostosis can be treated with <span style="color:#d89728; font-weight: bold">Open Repair</span> or
						<span style="color:#30a7b5; font-weight: bold">Endoscopic Repair</span>. Both surgeries produce normal head
						shapes and involve a plastic surgeon and a neurosurgeon.
						The Open Repair, or cranial vault remodeling,
						involves removing and reshaping skull bones, then
						securing them with dissolving plates and screws. The
						minimally-invasive Endoscopic Repair uses a small
						camera to remove sutures through one-inch incisions.
						Patients must then wear a helmet until one year of age
						to guide normal skull growth. <span style="font-weight: bold">Both repairs have equal
						physical outcomes, equal complication rates and are
						similar regarding post-surgery pre-cautions.</span></p>

			<h2>Helmets</h2>
			<div class="description">
			<p>Post-surgical helmeting is a critical part of <span style="font-weight: bold;"> endoscopic craniosynostosis repair.</span> Your baby’s custom-fitted helmet protects his or her head and also helps shape it. Parents and guardians need to be vigilant about helmeting in order to avoid re-operation. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="single" id="firstsection">
					<h3>Before surgery</h3>
					<p>
						About a week prior to your child’s surgery, you will visit a cranial orthotist who will make a custom helmet for your child. The finished helmet is frequently available for fitting the day after surgery, while your child is still in the hospital.
					</p>

					<h3 class="second">Follow up care</h3>
					<p>
						You will need to revisit the orthotist. How often depends on your child’s age. At first it may be every other week, but as your child’s growth slows down it may be once a month. As your baby’s head grows, the helmet will be adjusted to keep pace.
					</p>

					<h3 class="second">Immediately after Surgery</h3>
					<p>
						Your baby must wear the helmet almost all of the time (roughly 23 hours a day). You will receive written instructions on when the helmet may be removed.  
					</p>

					<h3 class="second">Important instruction</h3>
					<p>
						Post-surgical helmeting is just as important as the endoscopic surgical procedure. Parents and guardians will need to supply their time, as well as be compliant and communicative with their orthotist, in order for helmeting therapy to be successful.
					</p>

			<h2>Surgery FAQ</h2>
			<div class="description">
			<p>Following set of frequently asked questions is applicable to both procedures.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single">
					<h3>General</h3>
					<h4>When did the endoscopic program start at St.Louis Children’s Hospital?</h4>
					<p>
						The endoscopic program at St.Louis Children’s Hospital began in 2006.
					</p>

					<h3 class="second">Before Surgery</h3>
					<h4>Is there any kind of pre-testing that my child needs to have done before surgery?</h4>
					<p>
						Typically there is no pre-testing required. If your child has other health conditions additional testing will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
					</p>

					<h4>Will my child need to be admitted to the hospital the day before surgery?</h4>
					<p>
						No. Your child will come in the morning of the surgery.
					</p>

					<h4>How long will my child have to go without eating before surgery?</h4>
					<p>
						Your child will not be able to eat (NPO) for several hours before surgery. You will receive a call the day before surgery with the specific times at which your child will no longer be able to eat or drink. These times are based on the start time of your child’s surgery.
					</p>

					<h4>Can my child get vaccinations before surgery?</h4>
					<p>
						Yes. Your child should receive their routine vaccines at the regular times before and after surgery. 
					</p>

					<h3 class="second">After Surgery</h3>
					<h4>When will my child be able to eat or drink after surgery?</h4>
					<p>
						Clear liquids are given to the child shortly after surgery. If the child tolerates clear liquids they will then be moved on breast milk or formula. 
					</p>
					<h4>Will there be any dressing or bandages to change after surgery?</h4>
					<p>
						No. There will not be any bandages or dressing to change. The incision will have stitches that dissolve and surgical glue on top of the stitches. No ointments or creams will need to be applied. 
					</p>
					<h4>Will my child have to take any other medications when he/she comes home?</h4>
					<p>
						Most children are not discharged with any other medications. 
					</p>
					<h4>When can my child return to daycare?</h4>
					<p>
						About 1-2 weeks after surgery. Talk with your daycare provider to see if they have any other policies in place. 
					</p>

					<h4>Hospital stay:</h4>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Most children only stay one night after surgery.</li>
							<li>Parents/guardians may stay with the child in the hospital.</li>
							<li>As long as other family members are not sick, they may visit, however, they may not spend the night.</li>
							<li>For families coming from out of town, 
							you may return home after your child is discharged from the hospital. However, some families choose to stay in the St. Louis area for an extra day or two before traveling home. 
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p span style="color:#d89728; font-weight: bold;">* Each child is unique and the above answers may vary depending on circumstances with each child.</p>

<!-- SECTION 6 -->

		<div class="content3">
			<h2>Helmet FAQ</h2>
		<div class="single2">
					<h4>How many hours each day does my child need to wear the helmet? Can he/she take it off?</h4>
					<p>
						We recommend that the helmet be worn 23 hours a day. They helmet may be removed for cleaning and bathing, but otherwise should be kept on. 
					</p>

					<h4>How often will my child have to be seen to have the helmet adjusted?</h4>
					<p>
						In the beginning it may be as often as every 1-2 weeks. By the end of helmet treatment, it can be spaced out to about once a month. 
					</p>

					<h4>How long will my child have to wear a helmet after surgery?</h4>
					<p>
						Until they turn one year old.
					</p>

					<h4>How long after surgery will it be before my child gets his/her helmet?</h4>
					<p>
						If you live in St.Louis or the surrounding area your child will be fit with his/her helmet the morning after surgery. If you are not in the St.Louis area it is usually a day or two after surgery before your child gets the helmet. This allows for travel time to get home and to get in with your local orthotics provider. 
					</p>

					<h4>I don’t live in the St.Louis area. Will I need to travel to St.Louis for helmet treatment?</h4>
					<p>
						No. We work with a national orthotics company to find the closest cranial orthotists to your home. So all of your child’s helmet visits will be closer to your home. 
					</p>

					<h4>Why does my child need to be fit for his/her helmet before surgery?</h4>
					<p>
						A scan or cast of your child’s head is made by the orthotist (the person who makes and adjusts the helmets) about 5-7 days before surgery. The actual shape of the head does not change much during surgery, so this helmet will fit your child right after surgery. This process allows helmeting to start much sooner than if casting/scanning was not done until after surgery. 
					</p>

					<h4>How do infants adjust to the helmet?</h4>
					<p>
						Infants are very resilient to change and adjust to the helmet in a couple of days. It does not hurt them or cause headaches. It will also not delay their growth and development. 
					</p>

					<h4>How many helmets will my child need?</h4>
					<p>
						Most children end up needing between 2 and 4 helmets. 
					</p>
